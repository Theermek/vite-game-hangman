Welcome to Hangman - a classic word-guessing game brought to life with modern JavaScript! In this project, I've utilized Vite and Tailwind to create a sleek and responsive gaming experience.

What I've Accomplished:
I've crafted a fully functional Hangman game where players must decipher a hidden word by guessing letters. With each incorrect guess, the Hangman scaffold slowly takes shape, adding an element of suspense to the gameplay. The objective is simple: correctly guess the word before completing the Hangman or risking defeat by reaching 10 incorrect guesses.

Key Features:

Mobile-First Design: The game is designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring seamless gameplay across devices of all sizes.
Local Storage: I've implemented local storage to save game progress, allowing players to resume their session from where they left off.
Session Storage: Additionally, session storage is utilized for temporary data storage during gameplay sessions.
Dark and Light Mode Switcher: Players can customize their gaming experience with a toggle switch for dark and light modes, enhancing accessibility and aesthetics.
Adaptive Layout: The game features an adaptive layout that adjusts dynamically to accommodate various screen sizes and orientations.
